In anticipation of the release of his debut album, "Channel Orange," R&B dynamo Frank Ocean will make his network television debut with a performance on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon" on Monday night (July 9). Although it is unclear what song Ocean will perform, the singer will be backed by the "Fallon" house band, the Roots.   Following Friday's announcement, Ocean also posted a sensual new "Channel Orange" track, "Sweet Life," on his Tumblr blog. Check it out below.  "Channel Orange," due out July 17 on Def Jam, follows Ocean's acclaimed 2011 mixtape "Nostalgia, Ultra," in which the 24-year-old mixed original tracks with reinterpretations of songs by Coldplay, MGMT and The Eagles, among others. The studio album has been preceded by the nearly-10-minute single "Pyramids" and features guest appearances by Andre 3000, Earl Sweatshirt and John Mayer.  First Listen: Frank Ocean Previews 'Channel Orange' in NYC The "Fallon" booking follows a revealing personal statement from Ocean on Wednesday: on his Tumblr blog, the singer opened up about his sexuality and described falling in love with a man at the age of 19. Since posting the statement, Ocean has received support from Def Jam president Joie Manda, Def Jam founder Russell Simmons and Odd Future band mate Tyler, The Creator, among others.   Ocean's upcoming "Fallon" performance also comes one year after Odd Future made its network TV debut on the late-night, when Tyler and Hodgy Beats delivered a raucous performance of "Sandwitches" in February 2011. Ocean appears on the controversial group's "The OF Tape Vol. 2" album, which was released last March.The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn MoreÂ© 2018 Billboard.
