ERROR - IT SAYS THAT THE MAN HE FELL IN LOVE WITH WAS "IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER MAN" - THIS IS WRONG. HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND AND WAS NOT GAY. HOWEVER HE ADMITTED HIS FEELINGS TO FRANK 3 YEARS LATER. IT'S IN THE POST FRANK WROTE. READ IT AGAIN.— Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.45.89.145 (talk) 16:21, 4 July 2012 (UTC)
Hi folks, I recently read an article about Ocean concerning "Sound of 2012". In the clip you can easily see at the head of the page he says that california is the state he was born (not New Orleans/Louisiana). But because of some language difficulties i cannot understand the exact town. Maybe you can help me? --Music fanhere (talk) 19:23, 5 July 2012 (UTC)

Could the term Unrequited love be used in the sentence about Ocean's open letter about his experience? According to his letter, his feelings were not reciprocated. Dan56 (talk) 23:27, 11 July 2012 (UTC)
Someone needs to add the details surrounding the altercation between Ocean and Chris Brown Jan 27 Altercation — Preceding unsigned comment added by 174.232.145.124 (talk) 16:21, 6 February 2013 (UTC)

Thinkin' Bout You was not a song about his bisexuality. The song was actually written for Bridget Kelly (that chick who fills in for Alicia Keys at Jay’s live shows). It was produced by Shea Taylor
The guide vocal track that Frank did (to give Kelly a rough idea of how he wanted the song to sound) was subsequently leaked and went viral. Because of the response to the song Frank went back in the studio and remastered the track adding in background vocals and additional lyrics, with this version finding its way onto
Neither is the song Pink Matter. It's in fact about his mixed perception towards the female genitals.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 159.53.78.143 (talk) 19:34, 27 July 2012 (UTC)
We cannot include in the article claims about the actions of a living person, Ocean's father, that have as their sole basis a twit, one which is not even verifiable because it has been removed from the account. Unless / until reliable sources cover an actual court case filing, we cannot have such gossip in the article. -- TRPoD aka The Red Pen of Doom 15:08, 24 December 2012 (UTC)
Is there a reason why he is described as a 'ghostwriter'? Surely he was just a credited songwriter. If he was a ghostwriter then so is Max Martin a ghostwriter for Britney Spears or RedOne a ghostwriter for Lady Gaga. I think it's the wrong word to use. 123.122.0.156 13:43, February 12, 2013
I added to the page that Frank is also a rapper. In his solo career, he is only a singer-songwriter which originally was the only occupation listed. However, in OFWGKTA, there are several songs such as "Oldie" off of the group's album The OF Tape Vol. 2 and Tyler, The Creator's song "She" off his sophomore album Goblin in which Frank Ocean is actually rapping rather than singing (though he does actually sing the hook in "She"). I didn't add hip hop music to his genres because in his solo career he doesn't actually rap, however, he does rap in Odd Future. TomUSA 01:08, 16 March 2013 (UTC)
Please add this to Frank Ocean's personal life section -

In the late night hours of January 27, 2013, at Westlake Studio, Chris Brown approached Frank Ocean and his entourage and a fight broke out. Ocean's finger sustained a cut. Chris Brown was not there when officers arrived -- but they did speak to Frank Ocean. No one wanted to press charges, and no arrests were made.

.I think Hip hop is full of homophobia cuz i am a rapper and so far it has not been a good road for me(as a artist and a student). Cuz im trying to do wot im suppost to and i cant cuz all these other fooz are making a big deal otta it.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by MRivera25 (talk • contribs) 18:20, 22 October 2013 (UTC)
"Ocean became one of the first major African-American music artists to announce that he had fallen in love with someone of the same sex, notable because the music scene is known for homophobia.[63][64]"
if u wanna say hip hop is notorious for homophobia sure, but dont generalise it to all african american music please  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.7.236.204 (talk) 19:46, 12 August 2013 (UTC)
What genres does Frank Ocean really do?Does he do Hip hop, R&B, Soul or all three of em.--MRivera25 (talk) 18:18, 28 October 2013 (UTC)MRivera25
I know I don't have Wiki editing experience but  it says he is a Rapper and he isn't a Rapper a Rapper is someone like Lil Wayne . And the Statement that he wrote songs for Justin Bieber is untrue because Justin Bieber didn't become famous until 2007, So why would a Popular person write for Justin Bieber when Justin Bieber was a nobody . I'm Lil Wayne isn't going to write a Rap song for me to Rap because I'm just a Gamer and Partnered on YouTube but, I write my own songs. So a lot of this article need to be fixed badly  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2602:30A:2E0D:9C00:8081:4989:466D:4ACD (talk) 20:47, 9 August 2015 (UTC)

Christopher Francis "Frank" Ocean (born Christopher Breaux October 28, 1987), is an American singer, songwriter and rapper. Ocean started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as John Legend, Damienn Jones Justin Bieber, and Brandy.
In the article I would  like that name Damienn Jones and Tyler the Creator to be added in associated_acts? 
What wording would you like to be used? in the first portion of the article I want you to insert the name Damienn Jones after John Legend and before Justin Bieber.thank you

I wish to update Frank Ocean's Wiki photo as it's quite outdated. One from his Tumblr page would be ideal or simply a more recent photo that actually shows his full face. Thank you.

The SoundCloud link in the external links is broken. Instead of https://soundcloud.com/frank-ocean use https://soundcloud.com/frankocean
The notion that ENDLESS is one of the two versions of "Boys Don't Cry" that Ocean mentioned a year ago is pure speculation at this point. Someone with access should delete that bit.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 73.19.172.252 (talk) 06:15, 19 August 2016 (UTC)

Frank Ocean was born in New Orleans, LA. As referenced here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia,_Ultra#Background
The birth city should be changed from Long Beach, California to New Orleans, LA.
Editors Note: Prior comment was unsigned.

Top photo caption states "Ocean performing at Coachella in August 2012". Should be April, not August.

Consider explaining the acronym "OFWGKTA" that is placed throughout the page. "OFWGKTA" or "Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All", There is no clear explanation anywhere on Frank Ocean's Wiki page but the group is named throughout. Wickersham94 (talk) 02:49, 24 October 2016 (UTC)
In general, we only list the regular studio albums when there is an artist discography. Previously this article also listed a number of mix tapes. That is highly unusual and I would suggest it needs a thorough discussion here before it is included. Mainly because Frank Ocean is a high profile page and it would set a certain precedent for other articles with a similar output. Karst (talk) 11:41, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
I have opened this RfC due to the occasional removal of Nostalgia, Ultra from the Frank Ocean article's discography section. Developing a consensus for future reference couldn't hurt. Please place your votes under Votes and your explanation/comments under discussion. Dan56 (talk) 13:43, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
According to Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians/Article guidelines#Discography section, the discography section of the musician's primary article should "provide a summary of the musician's major works. In most cases this is done using a simple list of their studio albums, leaving a complete listing of releases to the discography article." I believe Nostalgia, Ultra is a major work for this artist and this is one of those uncommon cases where a simple list of studio albums doesn't suffice. The article gives enough coverage of this mixtape's significance in Ocean's career and discography to warrant inclusion in the section. I will highlight a key passage in the first paragraph of the lead: He released his breakout mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, to critical acclaim in 2011. It generated his first charting single "Novacane". In 2012, Ocean finished in second place in BBC's Sound of 2012 poll. There is also an entire subsection in the body of the article where the mixtape is the focal point; another key passage: The mixtape made Ocean widely known and led to his collaborations with rappers Jay Z and Kanye West.<c/ode> Furthermore, the largest portion of the "Controversies" section is a paragraph dedicated to one of the songs from the mixtape. The article on Nostalgia, Ultra itself fleshes out these points, particularly the Impact section. Dan56 (talk) 13:43, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
