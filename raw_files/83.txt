"Chanel" is a song by American singer-songwriter Frank Ocean, released as a single on the second episode of Blonded Radio. A remix featuring American rapper ASAP Rocky was also aired along with the song's premiere.[2]
On the morning of March 10, 2017, it was reported that Frank Ocean was set to release his second song of 2017.[3] "Chanel" followed the release of Scottish producer Calvin Harris' "Slide" featuring Ocean and American hip-hop group Migos.
"Chanel" is a slow piano ballad with Ocean rapping his verses and crooning the hook "I see both sides like Chanel/See on both sides like Chanel." Ocean uses the symbolism of duality to discuss sexual fluidity and masculinity. In ASAP Rocky's verse, he raps about ex-girlfriend Chanel Iman.[4][5]
Immediately upon its release, "Chanel" was praised for its lyrics related to sexual fluidity. Austin Williams from the website The Undefeated called the song "the coldest, gayest, and most securely masculine flex in the history of rap."[5] LGBT fans on Twitter called "Chanel" a bisexual anthem.[6] Pitchfork named the song as "Best New Track".[7]
On March 15, 2017, French luxury brand Chanel released two ads with the captions "We see both sides like Frank Ocean", flipping the lyrics of the song. A Chanel spokesperson told The Fader through email that "This is simply our way of acknowledging his nod to Chanel in his latest single."[8]
