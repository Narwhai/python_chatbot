This should be interesting!Cameras caught up to Frank Ocean on the red carpet at the TIME 100 Gala and the young singer-songwriter BLEW our minds with a massively interesting reveal about his next album!Traveling a few decades back for musical inspiration, the 25-year-old Thinkin About You singer is frankly — see what we did there?? — tapping into genres of music that we did not expect!!Frank admitted:“When I was making the first [album] there were a group of artists that I listened to, just for inspiration and to absorb the energies. It was a lot of Stevie Wonder, and this time it’s a lot of Beach Boys and Beatles and whatnot, so we’ll see how it trickles into the music and the final product. I can’t say much other than that.”Whoa!! The Beach Boys & The Beatles?!? Color us intrigued!!!Those are two of the greatest rock bands EVER; we can’t wait to see how he incorporates their styles into his sound!![Image via WENN & Capitol Records.]
