          Frank Ocean’s Boys Don’t Cry album still isn’t here — and that wait may not be coming to an end all that soon, after all. Producer Malay — who worked with Frank on Channel Orange — participated in an AMA on Reddit on Monday and, of course, was asked about the upcoming follow-up. There were rumors it was dropping earlier this month, after a live stream was posted on Ocean’s site. But that date, like a few others over the last couple years, came and went without an album.After one fan expressed, in a multi-paragraph question, the frustration and disappointment that some have felt as they wait and wait, Malay tried to bring in the artists’ perspective. “First of all we all massively appreciate and love you guys, Frank has told me this himself many times,” he wrote. “To be fair tho, art cannot be rushed. It’s about making sure the perfect aesthetic for the situation has been reached. To do that takes constant tweaking, trial, and error. That goes for any creative situation.”The wait continues. © 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved. MTV and all related titles and logos are trademarks of Viacom International Inc.
