Odd Future’s most recognizable members Tyler, the Creator and Frank Ocean recently went in front of the lens to film a video for “She,” the second single from Tyler’s solo album Goblin (May 10).  The OFWGKTA frontman shot scenes in a Los Angeles neighborhood with a pretty young thing as his leading lady.Singer-songwriter Ocean played double duty as a cop and “the man of the house,” almost unrecognizable in a white wig and drab attire.  In one of the more chilling images, Tyler stares into the camera as a gun is pointed at his head, wearing the same black contacts he sported in his viral sensation “Yonkers.”Browse more pics from the Odd Future clan’s shoot below.
