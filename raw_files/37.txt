An album and his own publication coming in JulyPhoto via TumblrThe long-awaited follow-up to Frank Ocean's  Channel Orange is apparently coming very soon. Today, Ocean shared the above photo on his website with the words "I got two versions" and three hashtags that seem to imply that his third release is called Boys Don't Cry and is out this July.Update: A rep for Ocean confirmed to Billboard that both a new publication by Ocean and a new album are coming in July. There's no title for either just yet.Reports from the album's sessions hinted that Ocean was working with Hit-Boy ("Niggas in Paris", Drake, Nicki Minaj), Rodney Jerkins (Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Destiny's Child), Happy Perez, Charlie Gambetta, and Kevin Ristro. It could include "Memrise".In the period since Channel Orange was released, Ocean has been busy. He performed at the Grammys. He won a Grammy. He appeared on Jay-Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail. He appeared on John Mayer's Paradise Valley. Hit-Boy also recently shared a snippet of a Frank Ocean-featuring Nas song called "No Such Thing As White Jesus", which came after Converse dropped a song called "Hero"—his collaboration with Diplo and the Clash's Mick Jones and Paul Simonon. All of this is to say nothing of a highly-publicized feud with Chris Brown, a drawn-out lawsuit with Chipotle, and his father suing Russell Simmons.Watch Frank Ocean's video for "Pyramids":
