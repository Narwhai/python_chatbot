"Frank's Track" is a song by American rap musician Kanye West, which was added to his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo (2016) when updates were made to it on 16th March 2016.
Frank Ocean originally had an outro on "Wolves", which appears on the same album as this song, but his outro was transferred to this separate track on March 16, 2016, during the process of updates.[1] However, "Frank's Track" still serves as an outro somewhat, since it comes straight after "Wolves" on the album's updated track listing.[2]
Within the same month that version of The Life of Pablo was released, before Ocean's vocals were transferred to the separate track from "Wolves", an alternative version of the song leaked online with him singing in the intro.[3]
There are no actual vocals by West on the track at all, since Ocean solely sings throughout over production from West, Cashmere Cat and Sinjin Hawke, so it's appropriately titled "Frank's Track".[2]
Despite the song being an update to The Life of Pablo when it was separated from the original featuring track, no updates were made to it post-release, unlike other songs that witnessed updates.[4]
The Independent described Ocean's vocals on the song as a 'stunning contribution'.[5] Highsnobiety gave a highly positive reception towards it with the question: 'What does it say about our cultural addiction to Frank Ocean that he can turn in a 30-second long studio demo and it becomes an essential part of someone elseâ€™s album?'.[6]
Upon the release of the featuring album, "Frank's Track" debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart and never charted again afterwards.[7]
