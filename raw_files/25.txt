Frank Ocean is carving out his own lane.  A Frankie look-alike gets behind the wheel of a race car in an arcade on the cover art for the Odd Future affiliate’s new single “Thinkin Bout You.”The tender ballad, which he originally penned for Roc Nation songstress Bridget Kelly, will be released to digital retailers on April 17, while Frank’s Def Jam debut is due later this year.“It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim,” he said of the follow-up to the acclaimed Nostalgia, Ultra.  “It’s about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness.”Tweets by RapUp Tory Lanez wants more smoke.
