your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear.
these types of secrets should not matter anymore, but we know they do, and because of that i decided to write this short statement of support for one of the greatest new artists we have.
his gifts are undeniable.
his talent, enormous.
his bravery, incredible.
his actions this morning will uplift our consciousness and allow us to become better people.
every single one of us is born with peace and tranquility in our heart.
