with a rumored tracklist hitting the internet earlier this week, much speculation has surrounded the upcoming kanye west and jay-z collaborative watch the throne album.
earlier tonight, ofwgkta&aposs frank ocean revealed on his tumblr (explaining his current situation to himself 5 years ago) that he is going to work with the duo on the much anticipated album.
i dont wanna spoil too much for you, but.. youre on a plane right now to the east coast to work with kanye west & jay-z.

you made it.it&aposs not much of a coincidence, seeing as how he already worked with hov&aposs wife beyonce on a track titled i miss you from her forthcoming 4 album.
