its true!frank ocean is making some new music magic!the grammy winner is well on his way to delivering us some new beats with already ten tracks completed, including some surprise collaborations.
in regards to the follow up to the 2012 smash hit channel orange, frank spilled: im like 10,11 songs into this next thing.
its another cohesive thing bordering on a concept album again.
at the end of ‘channel orange theres ‘golden girl and i kind of want to extend that feeling into the next record.
im going to bora bora when i get back and setting up a studio there and see what happens.
i was in the studio with pharrell just yesterday (february 18), tyler came by and we were just playing records.
as far as collaborations in the future for me, i dont know.
theres this kid king krule who is really sick and i would love to do something with.
he has a special voice, really cool.
im getting in with danger mouse when i get back to the states.
usually when i meet these guys if we happen to write something then we do but its good to just feel these things out.
i love tame impala, tyler put me onto them and theyre wicked.
their music has a freedom to it.
pharrell and tyler, the creator???
who else?
who else?ok…do whatever you need to do to get those creative juices flowing, but can you hurry it up just a little bit??!!
were still dreaming about your grammys performance and just cant wait to see what sounds you make next!
no pressure though.
lolz.
