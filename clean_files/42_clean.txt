‘art cannot be rushed frank oceans boys dont cry album still isnt here — and that wait may not be coming to an end all that soon, after all.
producer malay — who worked with frank on channel orange — participated in an ama on reddit on monday and, of course, was asked about the upcoming follow-up.
there were rumors it was dropping earlier this month, after a live stream was posted on oceans site.
but that date, like a few others over the last couple years, came and went without an album.after one fan expressed, in a multi-paragraph question, the frustration and disappointment that some have felt as they wait and wait, malay tried to bring in the artists perspective.
first of all we all massively appreciate and love you guys, frank has told me this himself many times, he wrote.
to be fair tho, art cannot be rushed.
its about making sure the perfect aesthetic for the situation has been reached.
to do that takes constant tweaking, trial, and error.
that goes for any creative situation.the wait continues.
