there are probably hundreds of guys named christopher breaux in south louisiana
at any given point there are probably a handful of guys named christopher breaux on the ul campus right here in lafayette but there was one particular christopher breaux who attended the university of louisiana at lafayette briefly in the fall of 2005 his name was christopher e breaux to be exact but you probably know him better as frank oceanyes that frank ocean was once a ragin cajun
i didnt believe it at first because ive always known but after a quick google search there it was in one of the only interviews ocean ever granted to the new york times back in february 2013 we also called one of our inside sources at ul and amongst the numerous students named christopher breaux still in the system there he was christopher e breaux  enrolled in fall of 2005earlier that year before making his way through baton rouge and across the atchafalaya basin bridge ocean graduated from john ehret high school in new orleans and enrolled to attend the university of new orleans in the fall to study english
by that point in his life he was already writing music but his songs were very amateur and unpolished
he wasnt even known as frank ocean yeteven though his legal name at the time was christopher breaux he later changed it to christopher francis ocean everyone knew him as lonny and its what most of his close friends and family still call him to this day
lonny continued to get deeper and deeper into music even though his mother believed that an education was more important for his future
he stuck with academics but music was clearly his focal pointalthough ocean is considered to be one of the most talented artists when comes to expressing himself through song his initial desire to pursue music had nothing to do with expression or artit was about the freedom and the mobility that having money would allow mein august 2005 hurricane katrina hit oceans hometown of new orleans
his recording studio was destroyed by the floodwaters and anything that the floodwaters didnt claim was looted
it was at that point that frank ocean transferred to the university of louisiana at lafayette
though he was continuing to pursue his education as a ragin cajun he wasnt recording music
so when a friend in los angeles offered him a deal on some studio time he packed up his car to head west and the rest is historyocean went on to la and would eventually link up with producers and fall into industry circles that led to him ghostwriting for the likes of justin bieber john legend and many other major recording artists
he connected with odd future in 2009 and later that year got a record deal as a solo artist with def jam through famed producer tricky stewartafter struggling to build a relationship with the label ocean eventually released a collection of music on his own called nostalgia ultra in february 2011 though it wasnt an official release through his label nostalgia ultra was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the year and strengthened his relationship with def jam
it also landed him in the studio with the likes of beyonce and other huge industry players within weeksin summer 2012 frank ocean released his official debut channel orange as well as an open letter via tumblr announcing that he was bisexual
he describes the moment that he revealed his sexuality as one of the scariest moments of his life but the news was well received by his fans and fellow artists alike
channel orange also saw huge success earning him 2013 grammy nominations for album of the year best new artist and record of the year for thinkin bout you
he won a grammy for best urban contemporary album as well the grammy for best rapsung collaboration for his work on jayz and kanye wests no church in the wildand to think his last stop before superstardom was in right here in lafayette la

frank oceans longawaited followup has been rumored to be released since july of last year and within those long 12 months the singers fans have been looking for any kind of clue as to where the reclusive songwriter and his anticipated project might be
today a major hint has come straight from the source as an image that points to a july release date has appeared on oceans official websitethe cryptic image shows a library card labelled boys dont cry with numerous stamps indicating various due dates
these dates begin with july 2nd 2015 which coincides with franks first announcement and conclude with july 2016 of course the first takeaway from this image would be to assume that frank is getting ready to put out the album this month
while its impossible to say for sure a post from franks brother ryan breaux further suggests a release this month
his instagram caption of the same library card photo reads boys dont cry july2016unfortunately there is no specific date mentioned so fans will just have to keep their fingers crossed

in the past weeks weve seemed to reach the peak of frank oceans mind games
while fans have been patiently waiting the release of his forthcoming album boys dont cry frank has been casually slipping in and out of the public eye with hints that the album is coming soon
earlier this month frank shared a livestream on his official website
many of us assumed this stream would end with an album release but once again we were all wrong
the stream stopped and frank seemingly disappeared
as fans continue to scramble for answers theyve started to use their spare time and energy to look for more clues
reddit users have recently discovered what seems to be the exact warehouse where franks stream was filmed
the available pictures on the site look very similar to the stills from franks livestream so it appears the internet detectives have solved another mystery
now if only we could get real answers about this release date
he is now frank ocean
frank ocean has officially changed his namedont worry
hes still frank ocean except now thats not just his stage name
its also his official name according to tmz
the long beach california singer was named christopher edwin breaux at birth
he filed to legally change his name to frank ocean in march 2014 according to the report drivers license issues held up the name change until nowthis year looks like its going to be a big one for ocean
in january he wowed fans with his cover of aaliyahs at your best you are love but theres even more in store
hes also reportedly planning to release an album and magazine in july
the album rumored to be titled boys dont cry is set to follow 2011s nostalgia ultra and 2012s channel orange© 2018 viacom international inc all rights reserved

listen to frank oceans new visual album endless httpstcoxeatxk2dphpictwittercomkek88xkhdzsitting in the corner of frank oceans circular staircase workshop in his 45minute endless video is a giant boombox
the boombox is the work of nycbased contemporary artist tom sachs
in an interview with pitchfork sachs revealed some interesting information about the making of endless most notably that the full cut of the video is about 140 hours longwhen you see the video you see him building a stairway to heaven in real time sachs said
that exists thats the art piecethe thing that were all seeing is the short is the edited version
this version where there are three of them is kind of a compressed experience where you see three frank oceans making the same thing
its not unlike the song on blonde called skyline to
you hear what sound like a couple of frank oceans singing over each other
i think thats his voice—i know a bunch of other people sing on it—but you hear him unapologetically laying two vocal tracks over each other the chorus and the refrain
and they overlap in the same way youve got a couple of frank oceans building the staircase and a couple of times in the video they cross through each other impossibly without collidingsachs asserted that oceans slow meticulous construction of the wooden staircase is meant in part to symbolize the fact that great art takes focus hard work and above all time  a lesson that he believes is important to remember in todays era in which art is often considered disposableif things that are made by hand take time this stands as something that we all can learn from and take an opportunity in whatever our work is and our lives to do things by hand and do things that speak of the individual sachs said

ocean the innovative and enigmatic rb singer is set to release his next album boys dont cry on friday through an exclusive deal with apple music according to a person with knowledge of the release plans
the release is also expected to include a major video and a printed publication called boys dont cry that will be distributed at apple storesmr
oceans album is expected to remain exclusive to apple for only two weeks before becoming more widely available according to that person who was not authorized to discuss the release plans and therefore spoke on condition of anonymity
but it is another coup for apple which has struck a series of deals with artists including drake future chance the rapper and the band the 1975 that have each given the companys streaming service an early lock on a hot new recorda spokesman for mr oceans label def jam did not immediately respond to a request for commentboys dont cry is one of the years most anticipated new albums and mr oceans first since channel orange in 2012 which was widely hailed by critics and nominated for six grammy awards it won one for best urban contemporary album
mr ocean himself first announced the new title three years ago and seemed to play with the long wait when he included the image of an oldschool library duedate slip labeled boys dont cry on a website connected to the album with a series of stamped dates going back over a year
given the number of delays the album has already had it seems possible that mr ocean could decide to put off the release beyond fridayon monday a mysterious video appeared on the same website showing a pair of workbenches in a large empty room
there was little other information — although the director francisco soriano briefly took credit for the video itself early monday in an instagram post that was later deleted — but many viewers did notice the apple music logo in a watermark on the feedrecently mr ocean has mostly relegated himself to guest duty while his fans awaited a new album popping up as an almost spectral presence on the life of pablo by kanye west and as a cowriter on the latest album from the british singer james blake
mr oceans most recent solo releases are a cover of the isley brothers at your best you are love in january 2015 and memrise a skeletal lofi recording posted to tumblr in november 2014mr
ocean spoke up sparingly during his retreat from musicin april he responded to princes death with a blog post
in june after the attack on a gay nightclub in orlando that killed 49 people mr ocean again surfaced on his personal tumblr with a longer piece of writingi heard on the news that the aftermath of a hate crime left piles of bodies on a dance floor this month he wrote
in 2012 around the time of the release of channel orange the highly private mr ocean wrote a note to fans explaining that his first love had been a man adding a personal layer to his emergence as a cult figure
boys dont cry would be the latest highprofile album to secure an exclusive deal with a major streaming service reflecting the intense competition among apple spotify and tidal the service controlled by jay z to lure new users and ingratiate themselves with top artistsbut the business of exclusive content has itself come under attack
in a series of twitter posts over the weekend mr west said that the competition between apple and tidal — in which exclusives play a major part — was hurting the music game and asked apple to give jay his check for tidal now which some people saw as corroboration of rumors that apple was interested in buying tidalapple did not respond to a request for commentadvertisement
‘art cannot be rushed frank oceans boys dont cry album still isnt here — and that wait may not be coming to an end all that soon after all
producer malay — who worked with frank on channel orange — participated in an ama on reddit on monday and of course was asked about the upcoming followup
there were rumors it was dropping earlier this month after a live stream was posted on oceans site
but that date like a few others over the last couple years came and went without an albumafter one fan expressed in a multiparagraph question the frustration and disappointment that some have felt as they wait and wait malay tried to bring in the artists perspective
first of all we all massively appreciate and love you guys frank has told me this himself many times he wrote
to be fair tho art cannot be rushed

762012 by jason lipshutz in anticipation of the release of his debut album channel orange rb dynamo frank ocean will make his network television debut with a performance on late night with jimmy fallon on monday night july 9
although it is unclear what song ocean will perform the singer will be backed by the fallon house band the roots
following fridays announcement ocean also posted a sensual new channel orange track sweet life on his tumblr blog
channel orange due out july 17 on def jam follows oceans acclaimed 2011 mixtape nostalgia ultra in which the 24yearold mixed original tracks with reinterpretations of songs by coldplay mgmt and the eagles among others
the studio album has been preceded by the nearly10minute single pyramids and features guest appearances by andre 3000 earl sweatshirt and john mayer
first listen frank ocean previews channel orange in nyc the fallon booking follows a revealing personal statement from ocean on wednesday on his tumblr blog the singer opened up about his sexuality and described falling in love with a man at the age of 19 since posting the statement ocean has received support from def jam president joie manda def jam founder russell simmons and odd future band mate tyler the creator among others
oceans upcoming fallon performance also comes one year after odd future made its network tv debut on the latenight when tyler and hodgy beats delivered a raucous performance of sandwitches in february 2011 ocean appears on the controversial groups the of tape vol

nononsense slow jamdetails record label def jam
nostalgia fills the drums as they kick listeners back to a time where emcees would surround like a campfire ready to cypher awaiting their turn to sink their teeth into the loop
when beats carry the same dirt found only in new york subways brooklyn street corners or harlem house parties in the apos90s its assumed that rappers will be getting down and dirtyodd future was never seen as offsprings of the old school they were more hipster than hardcore but on the song oldie from their 2012 project the of tape vol
2 the misfit collective took it back as the title suggestsevery male member from tyler to taco brought lyrics to the posse cut the beat had mere seconds to breath between rappers before the barrage of bars continued
earl had just come home—the prodigy was given the most room to let his pen bleed—but when the song came to a close the one who had left the most lasting impression was the groups promising songbirdthe rapper who stood out the most on oldie was frank oceanfrom driving supercars with friends to reminiscing about slaving over the hot grill at fatburger frankaposs verse is filled with memorable moments and quotable lyrics
he starts with a galaga reference that takes you back to losing endless quarters at the arcade finishing with a refrain addictive enough to become a hook and even secretly slides in a nod to his sexualityit was a small space but he paints a picasso on a canvas tiny enough to fit in a wallet
lyrics were delivered with ease and grace and for someone who gained mass attention for singing the way he rapped was more backpacker than rb sensationthe oldie verse wasnt the first time he delivered a rap for of on tylers debut studio album goblin the prominent singer arrived on the eightminute windows with a similar style—detailed storytelling poetic lyricism and an effortless delivery more akin to overhearing an intimate conversation
in a literary sense frankaposs verses are like reading prose the shade of purple lyricism flowered with colorful contentrb singers stepping into the rap domain isnt something new—chris brown trey songz and even neyo have entered the arena to varying degrees of success
itaposs even more current now in this era where the two genres have almost merged but its still obvious when a singer steps outside their natural artistic habitat
with frank his style of rap seems to be cut from a similar cloth as his singing—the same approach through a different mediumappearing on earls sunday from his album doris once again proved that his prowess for words can easily be shifted from falsetto to offbeat melodic rap flows
again in the presence of odd futures most heralded lyricist frank stands alongside sweatshirt rather than being eclipsed by him
an ocean verse that didnt receive much attention can be found on astro a track off the sophomore mellowhype album numbers
his melodic approach shows his ability to blur the lines between rapping and singing a style that would further be explored on his future albums
what truly stands out on astro is the hook where he raps about wearing a yellow tux to the grammys a man of his word
whats more rapper than living by your rhymesright before franks extended hiatus but after the release of channel orange frank released blue whale a raw unmixed tropical rap record
the production is sultry like putting your ear to a seashell
you feel as if youre walking along the beach with frank
the imagery he describes creates the surroundings and if you close your eyes the feeling of sand can almost be felt between your toeshis flow has been compared to mos def the skills cut from a backpackeraposs vein
i also can hear andré 3000 during his postoutkast remix era when he filled songs full of stories—particularly his verse on the remix of lloydaposs you
frank also reminds me of pharrell less eager more elegant but their ways of creating portraits in their rhymes are similarthe same way dj drama did in my mind prequel with skateboard p i would rejoice if mr thanksgiving gave frank his very own gangsta grillz to get these rhymes off
in 2013 on his tumblr page frank showed lyrics for a remix to the migoaposs versace but sadly never released the audio
it sounds like he was in the mixtape mindset and it wouldaposve been a great precursor to the album
blue whale is what made me believe that frank had a rap album in him and i secretly hoped that his resurgence would showcase frank the lyricist more than just frank the songwriter
i sort of got my wish with endless the visual album that has a few rare moments where the songbird breaks away from whats expected of him
both mine and unity are rap frank a streamofconsciousness that channels a unique slower flow
the words are perfectly enunciated—not a mumble in his stylethe way frank raps feels like the kind of flow drake would find interesting enough to borrow but so unlike whats happening in rap right now
theres a bounce in the beat and energy in his tonethe best moments on endless tend to be the shortest
franks flow on sideways is smoother than snowboarding down a hill of vanilla soft serve but it only lasts the length of a television commercial
out of all the songs that appear on endless i believe this couldve been a breakout single
slide on me is another blend of rapping sprinkled with melody—its butter slick a song that fits perfectly in this climate of young thug and post maloneendless seems to be a project made out of passion maybe evidence for an abundance of songs where frank takes more of a rap approach
there was room to experiment to utilize elements of his artistry that fans arent as acquainted with
blonde the album seen as his true sophomore release focuses more on his talents as a vocalist but he still finds room to tap into his inner rapper
on the opening track nikes just like his pitchedup vocals there are seamless switches between high notes and zigzag rapping
its pretty clear he doesnt see them as exclusively different but two forms of expression that he can utilize at any momenta perfect example is nights a song where frank is unpredictable theres no telling how the next note will be sung or the next bar spit
theres a rhythm to the way he rides the beat its like watching a waterfall flow into the oceanfutura free the final song on blonde is another rap with his vocals pitched up a departure from his natural voice
the long–winded verse seems freestyled loose—a noticeable difference compared to the refined perfection that he tends to execute
the honesty in his rhymes is what i always return to blonde is an album that embraces being transparent and futura free is extremely transparentthe way he writes is why i truly enjoy frank ocean
he uses words to illustrate and no matter if hes talking about crack rocks or selfcontrol the songs are illuminated by his use of language
rapping singing poetry—its all wordstheres no question he can write but the way words are delivered can make or break a rap artist
quentin miller has an excellent flow and a great delivery but he lacks the charisma that would make his style star worthy
drake had the charisma he lacks he brought the missing piece to the table and created an acclaimed project like if youre reading thiswith frank he has mastered a style that bridges his singing and rapping in an era where melody is king
do not sleep on rapping frank
andré 3000 may have the best verse on his last album but that doesnt change the fact hes an extremely talented wordsmith in his own rightif he ever decided to commit to and make an entire project thats driven by the mastery of his craft putting his backpack rapper skills to the forefront the hottest emcees list will have to make room for the phoenix from new orleans
by yoh aka yoh the prophet aka yoh31art credit dylan vermeulfrank ocean may have disappeared from music but his writing is some of todays most powerful art
frank oceans longawaited new studio album is his most adventurous project to datehow frank ocean gave the major label system the middle finger and blazed his own path to creative successfrank ocean and anderson paak are two singers that make their obsession with cars known in their musicfrank ocean has finally returned but he isnt the artist he was four years ago
frank joins quavo and lil uzi vert on aap rockys raf— and yep he got two versionsoften we are at our most brave when we are in tearsartists are an extension of their influences and the connection between choker and ocean is undeniable
though frank ocean has performed in new york before those shows were lesser moments by design to date hes appeared on stage with odd future and performed a lone solo show at bowery ballroom in november
the bowery show to be sure radiated signs of the talent promised by nostalgia ultra but it also seemed a little bit like a dress rehearsal after all since ocean was submerged for so many years he owed it to himself to try to figure out the live performance and you know maybe get in some onstage guitar hero
however last nights show bore all the trappings of a stars look from the towering prowess of oceans live band down to the thoughtful climactic setlist
last nights show proved that the question is no longer will frank ocean be a star
though frank opened the show with his understated sterling sade cover by your side he used that piece to build off of driving that more minimal acoustic setup toward fuller arrangements like thinking about you and sweet life
you could feel this wave of adrenaline in the crowd — my stars the crowd at this show — latched on to thinking about you screaming every lyric which was pretty much the way it went for every single channel orange cut throughout the night seriously people screamed themselves hoarse at terminal 5 last night
their voices as overpowering as thousands of voices can be couldnt even make a dent in the strength of oceans emanating voice to my ears he hit every note all night never trying to hide behind effects or reverb completely unafraid to sound like himself
it was a vocal performance worthy of a seasoned practiced veteran it might sound silly to applaud the professionalism of something youre paying to see but in a landscape where musicianship is not always the focus its sort of astounding see something that shows genuine prowess
it was like seeing r kelly or something — seeing someone whos already made a career out of bringing it each nightall of that serves as a good jumpoff for the song most people were waiting to hear all night the majestic bad religion
all night frank hadnt done much to directly engage the crowd only pausing to introduce songs or mutter new york city before being drowned out by screams
after that he played pyramids his longest song at ten minutes
i think i can safely speak for everyone by saying we could have all done ten moreafter stepping off stage for a moment he came back alone to play i miss you the song he wrote for beyoncé but one thats now totally his own just like how thinking about you a song ocean originally wrote for roc nation artist bridget kelly is now totally his own inseparable from his narrative
the life of i miss you is perhaps the best example of the gravity of frank ocean once you know its something hes written it no longer makes sense as someone elses song
01 by your side sade cover 02 summer remains 03 thinking about you 04 novocaine 05 sweet life 06 forrest gump 07 super rich kids 08 strawberry swing 09 made in america 10 american wedding 11 voodoo 12 white instrumental 13 crack rock 14 swim good 15 lost 16 bad religion 17 pyramids 18 i miss you
frank oceans legal name was once christopher edwin breaux but not anymore tmz reports that ocean has now officially changed his name to you guessed it frank ocean

742012 by erika ramirez early this morning july 4 frank ocean took to his tumblr to post a personal statement in which he opens up about his sexuality
in the piece which he intended to fill the thank yous section in the credits of his upcoming album channel orange ocean shares details of falling in love with a man
it was hopeless ocean writes
21 great gay moments in music ocean continues to share more of the relationship closing with i feel like a free man
odd futures tyler the creator took to twitter to congratulate ocean for his bravery fucking finally sus boy frankocean hahahaha you still aint got no bitches hahaha my nigga dawg
oceans admirable statement comes two days after rumors of bisexuality spread like wildfire over the net
after listening to his debut album channel orange a bbc1 xtras max writer posted a review of the album in which she says that by ocean using terms as him instead of her it suggests hes bisexual
my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of hte bullshit than we did

odd futures frank ocean comes outthe avantgarde hiphop group odd future has another lgbt member among its ranksfrank ocean 24 revealed in a note posted to his blog that his first love was a man he met four years ago
it was my first love it changed my lifeaccording to fader the message was intended to be part of the liner notes for his solo album channel orangetyler the creator oceans controversial group mate publicly expressed his support to ocean on twitterout recently interviewed syd the kyd the openly lesbian member of odd future who said the groups focus is to be truthtellers
7102012 there is a difference between frank ocean and the rest of his rb contemporaries
no it has nothing to do with his admittedly introverted demeanor or his odd future affiliation or penchant for playing guitar hero in time with a legendary eagles guitar solo
as he demonstrated on last years spectacular mixtape nostalgia ultra ocean is not afraid to adopt instrumentation choices outside of the rb realm dabble with different song layouts and most importantly present his audience with big questions that have nothing to do with sex
on nostalgia ultra ocean crooned about the apocalypse over a coldplay song two tracks later he was laying out his views on abortion and the moon landing
nothing about oceans musical and lyrical choices is conventional  and when his major label debut channel orange was previewed not with a radiofriendly pop jam but with a nearly 10minute concept piece titled pyramids fans of his bold stylistic maneuvers breathed a collective sigh of relief
frank oceans 10 best prechannel orange songs now that channel orange has arrived on itunes that sigh of relief has become a squeal of excitement
and rightly so over 17 tracks some of which spin into nothingness and others which poke longingly at the meaning of the universe channel orange presents a complex view of american life from the mind of superbly talented writer and vocalist
on channel orange ocean is preoccupied with wealth drugs and sex but instead of toasting his newfound fame and its spoils the singer pulls at the thread of their existence and paws at the idea of love and its place in between all of the shiny material
happiness is constantly out of oceans reach on these songs whether hes calling unrequited love a oneman cult or sitting on his roof wondering what his next move is when he has everything
but no matter what oceans mood is on the album the songs sound fantastic
the production never smothers the singers sumptuous vocals which spill over into pockets of air that the listener didnt know could be filled
channel orange does not contain any bad songs although there are times when oceans themes could be a bit tighter
yet oceans irrepressible spirit carries all 55 minutes of this opus shining light on subjects that are not discussed often enough and spinning new webs of ideas around familiar rb tropes
channel orange may make frank ocean a household name or it might not
either way its one of the best albums of the year and ocean hopefully will keep making more like it without a hint of reservation
which songs on channel orange are the best of the bunch
check out this trackbytrack review of the rb singers major label debut
1 start  patches of silence and flickers of noise get channel orange underway
its as if frank is giving his listeners 46 seconds to strap in
2 thinkin bout you a bold choice to lead off his major label debut with a song thats floated around the internet for a year
still the woozy heaven of thinkin bout yous backing track and oceans clawing falsetto still ring true and bestow channel orange with a unique backbone
3 fertilizer  an am radio jingle about bullshit fertilizer is a bridge between tracks 2 and 4 that underlines the importance of listening to orange in order
on its own its a lost pop doodle but in context the track makes weird sense
4 sierra leone  the percussion stays buried as ocean sounds like hes debating with his own spokenword statements
5 sweet life ocean places his sunglasses on and becomes the captain of a sumptuous soul cruise prodding the privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities
6 not just money  another quick interlude that once again ties together the two songs flanking it on the album
7 super rich kids featuring earl sweatshirt  a celebration of excess quickly dissolves into a basic plea for honest emotion and oceans odd future mate scoops up some rhymes about reckless driving
the steadiness of the beat is immediately familiar but wholly fresh  its like ocean snatched benny and the jets and threw the composition down a trap door into another universe
8 pilot jones  bleary electronic blips soundtrack this ode to a strungout woman that ocean cant help but adore
the central concept here is not as fleshedout as on other orange tracks but the footprints that do exist are striking
9 crack rock  while the cymbals come to life and twinkling keys inject some gravitas ocean delivers a scattershot examination of drugs corruption broken homes and gun violence
the ordeal sounds great but the songwriting is looser than it should be
10 pyramids the centerpiece of channel orange conjures images of cleopatras ancient betrayal before the dream slithers to an end and an even more dour vision of romance comes into view
the real triumph here is oceans song structure verses and hooks collapse onto each other rhymes pop up out of nowhere and the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10minute concept piece is no big deal
the song shimmies forward in a daze with ocean trying to find his love within the seduction of sin
12 white featuring john mayer  guitar noodling courtesy of mr mayer cant top the sparkling white that already exists on this years the odd future tape vol
13 monks  combining casual sex with devout religion and setting the shindig at a righteous concert and then a metaphorical jungle ocean crams a lot of ideas into a short running time
parts of monks may not fully work but the soupedup instrumentation largely covers any lyrical miscues
14 bad religion the most explicit rumination of oceans undefinable sexuality is also the most electric naked unmistakably affecting song he has ever made
oceans only mistake here is that bad religion is not the last song on channel orange because nothing can suitably follow it
15 pink matter featuring andre 3000  questions abound for ocean who lets grandiose ideas roll around in his mind and struggles choosing between sensory pleasure and universal meaning
andre doesnt necessarily work within oceans thematic confines but his flow bumps against the elastic beat before the song gloriously spirals into oblivion
16 forrest gump  like drakes practice ocean offers a late album track with a distinctly playful concept likening a crush to the titular hero of forrest gump
when removed from the heaviness of the album around it the lightweight gump is simple fun with a killer melody  but alas doesnt quite fit with the rest of oceans heartfelt compositions here

10182017 by cherie hu frank ocean beat a 145 million libel suit from his estranged father calvin cooksey on tuesday
after a daylong trial  which saw ocean his mother katonya breaux and cooksey take the stand  as law360 reports us district judge stephen v wilson ruled that cooksey hadnt provided sufficient evidence of defamationthe alleged evidence was a tumblr post that ocean wrote in june 2016 shortly after the mass shooting at orlandos pulse nightclub that killed 49 people
in the essay ocean recalled a childhood memory of being at a new orleans restaurant with cooksey when the latter called their transgender waitress an antigay slur before dragging ocean out of the restaurant because the waitress was dirtythat was the last afternoon i saw my father and the first time i heard that word i think although it wouldnt shock me if it wasnt ocean wrote
he did not call out cooksey by name nor did cooksey who represented himself at the trial produce anyone who saw the post and believed it was about him argued judge wilson

frank ocean isnt happy with chipotle
the singer posted a photo of a cashiers check on his tumblr with a special message to the burrito chain that indicated just how disgrunted he isthe check was for 212500 the amount that chipotle says ocean owes for reneging on a deal that involved delivering a song for a chipotle campaignat this point we dont know if hes looking to resolve this or if thats just a stunt said chris arnold chipotle communications directorocean was to record a version of the song pure imagination for chipotles animated film and video game the scarecrow
the campaign is meant to promote sustainable farming something the brand has highlighted since it started in 1993chipotle paid ocean 212500 up front for the song but ocean refused to do it he says he was only interested in promoting the farming not chipotlewhen frank was asked to participate in this project chipotles representatives told him that the thrust of the campaign was to promote sustainable farming read an email that oceans counsel sent to chipotle
there was no chipotle reference or logo in the initial presentationbut chipotle is arguing the connection between chipotle and the chipotlefunded video was always therewe hired frank to record a song for us and he ended up walking away from that project said chipotles arnold

fiona apple has revealed frank ocean was originally supposed to soundtrack the chipotle commercial she eventually lent her vocals toin an interview with pitchfork the singersongwriter said she ended up soundtracking the short film which was made to promote a new chipotle app with a haunting cover of pure imagination after the odd future member lost his voicechipotle was in a big rush and they initially wanted frank ocean but he screwed up his voice she told the us websitelisten to pure imagination belowapple then went on to describe her fears at covering the famous song from the 1971 film willy wonka  the chocolate factory
acting legend gene wilder sings it in his role as the famous chocolate factory owner and apple admitted she was worried if he would take offence at her coverthey wanted to use pure imagination a song i wanted to do in a show when i was 18 but was too afraid to
i didnt want gene wilder to be upset about that song being sung by some idiot she told pitchfork adding i thought that i had the best chance of doing it well
this is the absolute truth the only person that i care what they think of the chipotle commercial is gene wilderwere sure apple has nothing to worry about her haunting delicate cover has been praised internetwidemore about frank ocean
hes the singersongwriter who emerged this year to be the one everyones watching
frank oceans free mixtape catapulted him to your consciousness and now he wants to stay there
its deeper than rbwords by elliott wilsonimages by nabil elderkinmr
ocean stopped by the otolaryngologists office this morning
the most embraced singer in the hiphop community wanted to make extra sure that the long hours in the studio working on his upcoming album hadnt damaged his voice
the man behind the acclaimed mixtape of the year nostalgia ultra is giddy as he shows me an xray of his throat
the doc gave him a clean bill of health and now lonny breaux can continue his journeymr
ocean also got a tattoo removed today as evidenced by the big bandage sticking out from under his gray tshirt on the left side of his chest
but hey hed have to be in order to be a member of the rambunctious force known as odd future
this interview took place at platinum studios in cali during a recording session of of front man tyler the creator who often interrupted things to crack jokes about bet and to lament the fact that hes still nursing a broken footyup its a family affair as husbandandwife management duo christian and kelly clancy hold court and the somewhat shy and guarded vocalist opens up about his life
like tyler ocean is not a fan of being a part of something like an interview where he doesnt have complete creative control over how it turns out
 the shoot to this story looks like its gonna be pretty interestingfrank ocean i was always saying that if ever i was allowed to make a whole lot of money in this business or any other business for that matter i would move to an island that i either have a longterm lease on or that id own
i was so nonchalant about it because i think as a songwriter when you get on that side of it it disillusions becoming a recording artist a little
i had strategies all lined up release schedules and heres how were gonna put the show together and this is what were gonna do to create a buzz and make sure people are there
months and months went on and none of those ideas or strategies were being funded and i was just like fuck—studio wasnt funded and a bunch of things
no matter who jumps off the train im gonna get itso thats how nostalgia came aboutyeah thats nostalgia
once i started writing in march 2010—march to may maybe i was writing and all throughout trying to lock down studios to record this shit
i mean you dont know how many songs i wroteokay so you cut it down…like for nostalgia i wrote a pretty modest number of songs
but even before im just saying i was creating songs on such a regular basis
an old friend of mine told me that songs you dont finish—they just end up in an interesting place or they dont
i would work on these songs until they were in an interesting place and it was the first time i did that sequencing it interludes mixing the record
and it was intentionalstill it seemed like as soon you dropped nostalgia it took offi put nostalgia out on february 16 first day it had like 60 downloads or something
but it hasnt been pulled yetwhen did it really click for you that this project was going to jumpstart your career
i think people in the urban music scene place too much of a premium on collaborations to begin with
and second i think that people shouldnt be on magazines that they wouldnt read and shouldnt really feature on songs that they wouldnt listen to if they werent on itso you want to take a different path and keep things freshexactly
even after i spoke about being a little jaded at first on the whole recording artist idea and the pursuit of that
i think some of the jaded shit has worn off cause im in a different place and its been replaced by this certain optimismyoure being recognized now which probably fuels more artit does it does
like when i wrote the second album which im finishing up now trying to tie up all the loose ends but its written already
there was an interesting mind frame i had when i was writing it that was different from when i was writing nostalgia
i wrote this project down
im a jayz enthusiast and that contributed to me learning how to write in my head and thats what i did for nostalgia
the new album i wrote all on a laptop all in a standard fonteveryone is excited about your two appearances on watch the throne
when i walked in the studio for the first time he was the intimidating jay at first
we worked on a song that he had a verse already written for
it kind of had to do with the concept of the song
so i wrote out the hook and when i was singing it jay came in the booth
i was doing some experimental things with accenting and from there we started talking briefly about where the song was going
i was just making sure my bases were covered
i had just got a cut back for the novacane video so i played it for them
it was one of the cooler moments id had with them so fardid they have ideas about what songs they wanted you to enhanceit was really collaborative so we just went through beats
we didnt really talk about themes but i laid out some song concepts and hooks
they built the songs from the hooks
kanye and jay had a big impact on me so being able to work on a project like that is as much a part of the dream as anything else
i know youre not too comfortable with the rb labeli just think rb is so racial
pharrell has told me to say im a singersongwriter because thats what i really am
i dont want to step off into the dont label me because im black realm but i would say any artist that is killing it right now has long since abandoned genre and expanded past certain labels
do you feel pressure with the next album
are you concerned about a sophomore jinx or the perception that you cant top nostalgiadamn you just introduced that into my conscience
you just inspired an additional verse or definitely interlude fodder
theres definitely pressure on this album
anyone who has something invested in this album has added to the pressure
i know some people who complain about artists creative freedom but those people are stupid as fuck

nostalgia ultra stylized as nostalgiaultra
and occasionally nostalgiaultra is the debut mixtape by american singer frank ocean
it was released on february 16 2011 in may 2011 def jam announced its plans to release the mixtape as an ep on july 26 2011 however the release of the ep was indefinitely delayed in july 2011 and has since been cancelled
two singles were released from the aborted ep version novacane and swim good
both songs received music videos directed by australian director nabil elderkin
ocean embarked on a solo concert tour through north america and europe to promote the record playing a total of 7 shows
in addition his 2012 performance at the coachella music festival included several live renditions from the release including strawberry swing and lovecrimes
the mixtape appeared on several music critics and publications endofyear albums lists
controversy arose in march 2012 over the song american wedding a remake of the song hotel california by american rock band eagles
recording artist kanye west was reportedly a fan of the mixtape which led to ocean appearing on the album watch the throne
subsequently ocean collaborated with artists beyoncé knowles and jayz after they were introduced to the mixtape through west
following its release both ocean and the mixtape have developed a cult following
the mixtape was followed by the release of oceans debut studio album channel orange to even greater critical acclaim in 2012 frank ocean was born in long beach california
he made the decision to pursue a career in music at a young age and as a teen he did neighborhood chores to fund his early studio sessions
after hurricane katrina hit his hometown of new orleans ocean moved to los angeles to pursue a recording career
eventually he landed songwriting gigs for established artists like brandy john legend and justin bieber where he made substantially more money
the mixtape samples songs from radiohead coldplay mgmt mr hudson and the eagles which ocean sings over
in his own words ocean calls the album nostalgic
when asked by the quietus if the songs from the album drew from his personal experiences frank commented my kitchen is usually pretty clean you know
people think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life but its not
the album begins with a melodic cover of strawberry swing by english alternative rock band coldplay
several interludes are placed throughout the album named after video games such as street fighter metal gear solid goldeneye 007 and soulcalibur
pitchfork media wrote that in a skit called bitches talkin the ladies tell him to cut it out with the damn radiohead while optimistic is playing in the background in songs for women he obliges—hes an indie kid when it comes to alienation but a pragmatist when it comes to sex
the mixtape also contains several references to american director stanley kubrick and his films most notably eyes wide shut
swim good has been called an astonishing suicide song and that ocean finds himself dressed in black like im ready for a funeral tormented by heartbreak and on the verge of driving his car into the sea
the penultimate track is american wedding a 7minute remake of hotel california by american rock band eagles
nostalgia ultra received widespread acclaim from critics
at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications the mixtape received an average score of 83 based on nine reviews
in his review for msn music robert christgau described oceans romantic laments as models of texture respect and profound loss their beats subtle seductive weird and seized like time whether hes deploying songs for women that are soon trumped by drakes not feeling a pornmoonlighting dental student and her novacaine or annulling a courthouse wedding solemnized just before his bride turned in her term paper on hijab
on may 19 2011 oceans record label def jam announced its plans to release an ep containing tracks from nostalgia ultra
novacane was officially released as the first single from nostalgia ultra on may 31 2011 swim good was released as the second single from the mixtape on october 18 2011 and the song charted at position 70 on the billboard rb chart for three weeks
ocean embarked on a sixdate concert tour from november 5 to november 15 2011 through north america and europe to promote both the mixtape and his other musical projects
rolling stone reviewed the debut show calling ocean awkward at times though they stated that fortunately his dispassionately told stories of love and loss in a world that assumes impermanence could handle the load of the audience
the set lists to the various shows varied though singles swim good and novacane were performed at all shows
others tracks like lovecrimes dust and american wedding were performed at a majority of the shows and strawberry swing we all try were performed four times each
before the release of nostalgia ultra ocean was a relatively unknown artist who made a majority of his money from ghostwriting
west also offered to appear on oceans debut album but ocean refused saying as much as i want to work with you… i kind of want to do this without you
ocean quickly became odd futures main singing highlight providing vocal hooks on odd future albums like blackenedwhite goblin and the odd future tape vol
2 the record was nominated for best international album at the 2012 swedish grammis awards
rolling stone named it the 24th best album of the year writing the debut mixtape from the 24yearold singer and odd future member is an avantrb killer
the track novacane also received widespread critical acclaim
it was listed as one of the best songs of the year by the new york times in march 2012 controversy arose over the track american wedding which samples the eagles song hotel california
don henley of the eagles had threatened legal action over oceans track claiming that oceans version of the song was illegal
a spokesman for the band announced that a lawsuit would be filed against ocean if performed the song live
frank ocean did not merely sample a portion of the eagles hotel california he took the whole master track plus the songs existing melody and replaced the lyrics with his own
for the record don henley has not threatened or instituted any legal action against frank ocean although the eagles are now considering whether they should
several publications noted that the song was released for free on a nonprofitable mixtape and that live covers of famous songs are common in live performances and that sampling is a common practice on mixtapes
ocean responded to the controversy via his tumblr account he they threatened to sue if i perform it again
they asked that i release a statement expressing my admiration for mr henley along with my assistance pulling it off the web as much as possible
i didnt make a dime off that song
i released it for free
ocean performed the song live occasionally with an altered arrangement not utilizing the original hotel california sample
henley eventually spoke out on the controversy defending his stance on the 2012 litigation threat and referring to ocean as talentless

it was released on july 10 2012 by def jam recordings
after releasing his mixtape nostalgia ultra in 2011 ocean began writing new songs with malay a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording the album at eastwest studios in hollywood
rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on channel orange
he titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon graphemecolor synesthesia and the color he claimed to have perceived during the summer he first fell in love
channel orange has an unconventional musical style filminspired segue tracks and songs that draw on electrofunk popsoul jazzfunk and psychedelic music
oceans songwriting touches on themes such as unrequited love decadence class and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery conversational devices and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters
his singing on the album exhibits freeform flow and alternating falsetto and tenor registers
the album features guest appearances from odd future artists earl sweatshirt and tyler the creator along with appearances from andré 3000 and john mayer

frustrated with def jam recordings inactivity in his recording career ocean released his debut mixtape nostalgia ultra online for free in february 2011 ocean started writing songs for channel orange in february 2011 with songwriter and producer malay his friend and creative partner since their start in the music industry as songwriters
although ocean had creative freedom for both projects he felt more confident as a songwriter for channel orange and typed his lyrics on a laptop rather than composing in his head as he had done for nostalgia ultra
in june 2012 during their writing sessions malay noticed oceans use of gender pronouns in his lyrics but attributed it to oceans poetic license rather than his sexuality
once the songs were written ocean ordered them into what ultimately became the albums track listing and began recording them in that order
ocean recorded his vocals alone for several months striving intensively for high performance standards before rejoining malay for the albums production
their production also emphasized instrumentation and was a departure for ocean after nostalgia ultras reliance on samples
in the wake of nostalgia ultra other artists took interest in ocean and contacted him about working together leading to collaborations on channel orange
ocean and malay mixed channel orange at studio for the talented and gifted and engineer spike stent mixed parts of the album at the mix suite in los angeles
ocean titled the album as a reference to graphemecolor synesthesia a neurological phenomenon in which an individuals perception of numbers and letters is associated with the experience of colors
according to music journalists channel orange has an unconventional musical style less melodic and hookoriented than nostalgia ultra —ken tucker npr channel orange has themes of unrequited love oceans songwriting uses descriptive narratives the opening track start is a snippet of ambient sounds sweet life and super rich kids depict decadent pyramids is cited by writers as the albums centerpiece
pink matter is a bluesy lament with themes of sex and betrayal to prevent channel orange from leaking onto the internet ocean planned to release it digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date

at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications the album received an average score of 92 based on 46 reviews
reviewing the album for allmusic andy kellman wrote that oceans descriptive and subtle storytelling is taken to a higher level than on nostalgia ultra some reviewers were more qualified in their praise
in rolling stone jody rosen preferred the albums more structured songs and argued that ocean sometimes seemed to be less a songwriter than a purveyor of formless grooves
at the end of 2012 channel orange was named the years best album by numerous publications including the chicago suntimes chicago tribune billboard entertainment weekly the guardian the los angeles times the sydney morning herald now paste popmatters slant magazine spin and the washington post

sweet life is a smooth rb track with a 1970s aesthetic
the song is set in ladera heights california declared as the black beverly hills by ocean
the track has drawn comparisons to the style of 808s  heartbreak a studio album by rapper kanye west noted for its jarring use of autotune
sweet life was raved by music critics
john calvert of the quietus described the song as really big
if you were looking around for a high concept pitchstyle descriptor with its synth brass and philly soul strings you might call it stevie wonder meets nerd in space
but then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted resolutely accomplished sweet thing
greg kot writer for the chicago tribune stated that the track seduces like a drug dealer with ocean crooning over a laidback rhythm

franks track is a song by american rap musician kanye west which was added to his seventh studio album the life of pablo 2016 when updates were made to it on 16th march 2016 frank ocean originally had an outro on wolves which appears on the same album as this song but his outro was transferred to this separate track on march 16 2016 during the process of updates
within the same month that version of the life of pablo was released before oceans vocals were transferred to the separate track from wolves an alternative version of the song leaked online with him singing in the intro
there are no actual vocals by west on the track at all since ocean solely sings throughout over production from west cashmere cat and sinjin hawke so its appropriately titled franks track
despite the song being an update to the life of pablo when it was separated from the original featuring track no updates were made to it postrelease unlike other songs that witnessed updates
the independent described oceans vocals on the song as a stunning contribution
upon the release of the featuring album franks track debuted at number 5 on the us billboard bubbling under rbhiphop singles chart and never charted again afterwards
a week after the singersongwriter came out on his tumblr page he drops an album—saving some fearlessness and honesty for his musicfrank ocean performs during the 2012 coachella music festival at the empire polo club on april 13 2012 in indio california
year 2012artist frank oceanlabel def jam follow timeculturefrank ocean isnt a household name yet but there are a few things you should know about him
hes a member of one of hiphops hottest and most controversial collectives odd future wolf gang kill them all also known as ofwgkta or more succinctly odd future
he was featured on kanye west and jayzs critically acclaimed album watch the throne
he has written tracks for justin bieber john legend and brandy under his given name of christopher lonny breaux
hes a poster child of the free music generation—he gave away his impressive debut mixtape nostalgia ultra via his tumblr after feeling ignored by his label island def jamhe is gay or perhaps bisexual—which might seem irrelevant except that he just came out on july 4 via his tumblr telling the world that his first love was a man
afterward jayz beyonce and russell simmons all voiced their encouragement of the young star even tyler the creator the notoriously ersatz leader of odd future gave his friend a tweet of support
in a hiphop world that is not known for being particularly inclusive of homosexuality this is big news
more frank ocean rb singer and rapper reveals his first love was a mangiven that oceans announcement came a week before his new album dropped it could be viewed as a publicity stunt
but by coming out ocean also gives channel orange a context in which his heartwrenching lyrics and despondent songs draw attention to his struggle with identity sexuality and encroaching fame
the lyrics elevate the album from being just another aboveaverage rb record to a brilliant release sure to top many best of liststhe highly anticipated new album features oceans emotionally rich hookfilled tracks along with clever collaborations with earl sweatshirt john mayer and andré 3000 all topped off with his tenminute rb opus pyramids
on channel orange ocean crafts pure rb firmly distancing himself from the angry teenage hiphop of odd future and even from his work on watch the throne
while rb artists such as usher and chris brown have started to incorporate the influence of electronic dance music into their songs ocean remains resolute in his idiosyncratic style while still bringing to mind old usher thedream and even maxwell
the tracks bounce between sultry slow jams like white with john mayer and pink matter which puts andré 3000 of outkast fame to good use solidifying the chorus with his fast rhyming to the poignant hymn bad religion to the whistleladen track forrest gump
ocean has a flair for crafting gripping songs and this album does not lack melodrama featuring haunting melodies paired with driving beats and touching lyrics similar to the elusive brilliance of thedreams love hate
more coming out in hip hop frank oceans powerful momentthe albums first single pyramids is in and of itself a tour de force
the track is a tenminute history of rb arcing from club thumping beats to a sultry drawn out jam with oceans voice veering from a velvety croon to an endearingly creaky falsetto
the beats alternate between spacey and sexy driving and drawn out
despite the length of the song the track easily holds your attentionthe album is a mature album especially from one so young
the fact that no two songs sound alike show a virtuoso on the rise
the lyrics reveal a selfawareness that comes with maturity but also show a young man in flux
on the sweet life ocean seemingly shakes his head at those tied to the fripperies of wealth why see the world when youve got the beach
while the track was cowritten with pharrell williams it seems deeply personal to ocean who grew up in new orleans and now lives in beverly hills as the issue of the trappings of money and class disparities show up again and again on the album
on the bluntly named track super rich kids he sings too many rich kids with nothing but fake friends exploring his discomfort around the titular rich kids
the track which is his joint effort with his odd future bandmate earl sweatshirt is a stand out tying together the albums two themes of class and love
ocean chides the maids come around too much parents aint around enough while the chorus pleads that he is searching for a real love which cant be found in a world of wealth
ocean structures his narratives cleverly tying together the albums outros and intros with samples of organs waves and tape deck sounds along with spoken interludes that focus on money and jobs
ocean used a similar technique on nostalgia ultra but hes mastered it here
more frank ocean nostalgia ultra – the top 10 everything of 2011debating class money and love on an rb album is heady stuff for a 24 yearold who is growing up in the spotlight and in the generation of internet oversharers who live their lives on tumblr and twitter
the strain of finding fame and fortune at a young age seems to be taking a toll on ocean as many of the tracks on the album are infused with a deep melancholy
on bad religion ocean sings taxi driver be my shrink for the hour leave the meter running  its rush hour so take the streets if you wanna just outrun the demons could you
in the context of oceans recent statement about his sexuality its hard not to read the lyrics as a young man struggling to find solace
but as elton john says sad songs say so much
when ocean sings i can never make them love me it sounds like a challenge and it seems clear that hes up to itmore chris browns fortune a mix of beats and ballads but no regrets

 trpod aka the red pen of doom 1508 24 december 2012 utc is there a reason why he is described as a ghostwriter

— preceding unsigned comment added by mrivera25 talk • contribs 1820 22 october 2013 utc ocean became one of the first major africanamerican music artists to announce that he had fallen in love with someone of the same sex notable because the music scene is known for homophobia
if u wanna say hip hop is notorious for homophobia sure but dont generalise it to all african american music please — preceding unsigned comment added by 717236204 talk 1946 12 august 2013 utc what genres does frank ocean really dodoes he do hip hop rb soul or all three of emmrivera25 talk 1818 28 october 2013 utcmrivera25 i know i dont have wiki editing experience but it says he is a rapper and he isnt a rapper a rapper is someone like lil wayne 
and the statement that he wrote songs for justin bieber is untrue because justin bieber didnt become famous until 2007 so why would a popular person write for justin bieber when justin bieber was a nobody 
im lil wayne isnt going to write a rap song for me to rap because im just a gamer and partnered on youtube but i write my own songs

wickersham94 talk 0249 24 october 2016 utc in general we only list the regular studio albums when there is an artist discography
previously this article also listed a number of mix tapes
mainly because frank ocean is a high profile page and it would set a certain precedent for other articles with a similar output
karst talk 1141 17 december 2016 utc i have opened this rfc due to the occasional removal of nostalgia ultra from the frank ocean articles discography section
developing a consensus for future reference couldnt hurt
dan56 talk 1343 17 december 2016 utc according to wikipediawikiproject musiciansarticle guidelinesdiscography section the discography section of the musicians primary article should provide a summary of the musicians major works
in most cases this is done using a simple list of their studio albums leaving a complete listing of releases to the discography article
i believe nostalgia ultra is a major work for this artist and this is one of those uncommon cases where a simple list of studio albums doesnt suffice
the article gives enough coverage of this mixtapes significance in oceans career and discography to warrant inclusion in the section
i will highlight a key passage in the first paragraph of the lead he released his breakout mixtape nostalgia ultra to critical acclaim in 2011 it generated his first charting single novacane
in 2012 ocean finished in second place in bbcs sound of 2012 poll
there is also an entire subsection in the body of the article where the mixtape is the focal point another key passage the mixtape made ocean widely known and led to his collaborations with rappers jay z and kanye westcode furthermore the largest portion of the controversies section is a paragraph dedicated to one of the songs from the mixtape
the article on nostalgia ultra itself fleshes out these points particularly the impact section
