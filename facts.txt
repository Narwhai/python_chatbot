he starts with a galaga reference that takes you back to losing endless quarters at the arcade finishing with a refrain addictive enough to become a hook and even secretly slides in a nod to his sexualityit was a small space but he paints a picasso on a canvas tiny enough to fit in a wallet
i sort of got my wish with endless the visual album that has a few rare moments where the songbird breaks away from whats expected of him
theres a bounce in the beat and energy in his tonethe best moments on endless tend to be the shortest
out of all the songs that appear on endless i believe this couldve been a breakout single
